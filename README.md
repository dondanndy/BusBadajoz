# BusBadajoz

This is just an app made for fun (and at the same time learning how to make an Android app).

Considering the state of the existing app to see the bus schedule I thought it would be nice to have a better alternative.
There is no API for it so we have to scrap the bus company website, as you will be able to see in the code.

At the moment the app is not usable.
Only parts of the interface are fully implemented, and the logic behind it needs a bit of work.
So no, don't expect to use this right now.

### 2021 Update

As you can see the code hasn't been updated since 2018. The bus company changed its website bach then and now there is a xml API that can be easily reverse engineered. I might get into this when I get some time.
